- Purpose -
-- This document should give an understanding of how the access system works --

- Overview -
-- The Access system is implemented on Roles:Modules:Views:Sections --
-- Sections are partitioned into different functons on the View -- 
-- Example. The Users Module has the 'list_users' View --
-- This View has the 'list_users_sec' Section --
-- This section shows as a list of all users -- 
-- An admin user can then Edit, Delete and Add users at will -- 
-- The Edit, Delete and Add functions require different levels of permission --
-- Example to Edit you need 'Read and Execute' permissions --
-- To Delete and Add Users you need Execute Permission. 

- Permissions - 
-- Write -- To trigger Edit / Save functions. 
-- Execute -- To trigger executable functions such as Add / Delete / Save / Print
-- Write / Execute -- To trigger both Write and Execute functions 


-- Modules -- 
-- This should be defined in terms of the functions it performs --
-- Example... the Users Module houses all user related operations --
-- The Users Module has the 'list_users' and 'add_user' views --
-- These views have the 'list_user_sec' and 'edit_user_sec' respectively --
-- Authentication is done on Module:View and in the view templates on Section:permission --
-- and all that is attached to a Role that is assigned to a user when being added --
-- NB. That all Add and Edit functions uses the same views --
-- Example the 'add_user' view is used by the edit_user view so we dont add views for the edit functions --
